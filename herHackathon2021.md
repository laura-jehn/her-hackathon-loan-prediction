## How to Match AI & Inclusion - Deloitte - HerHackathon 2021

The dataset emulates a common loan default prediction task, but the data is generated in such a way that default prediction machine learning models are likely to be biased against women and minorities. The task is to detect and minimize wrongful discrimination.

You are welcome to use ***other open data sets*** on the internet to showcase the bias against women in datasets and AI algorithms.

### ***Technologies***:
- upto you and your team

### Our ***goal*** for you is to:
- analyze the problem in general
- narrate different solutions to the problem, analyze pros & cons for the available solutions
- identify the kind of biases in the data set
- steps to minimize wrongful discrimination
- process to apply your findings on other data sets
- create great visualizations to highlight the bias in your datasets

### For all the ***developers***, examples where you could contribute (you're not limited to this, so, you can be creative):
- a tool to upload different datasets and run the algorithm 
- create great visualizations to help with your story
- help your data scientists with data cleaning & transformations

#### For the ***data analysts & scientists***, examples where you could contribute (you're not limited to this, so, you can be creative):
- describe the problem at hand with more details / a storyline
- help with pitch creation
- identify datasets where such biases could be a problem
- describe a process on how wrongful discrimination can be minimized


#### At the ***end***, we would like to see:
- a pitch with your idea
- a short live-demo of your developed tool/ app / visualizations
- a short summary of the way your team worked (how did you approach the problem, how did you split work, who did what, why did you do it this way, what went well, what can be improved)

#### If you ***need help***:
- write us on slack!

***Be creative & have fun!***
